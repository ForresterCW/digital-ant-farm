Welcome to my little hobby project! 

I have had this idea for a really long time, as it seems to be surprosongly hard to get a physical ant farm in the hosue. 

I have always loved ants and their dynamics, and I think their natural pheremone-based pathfinding would make them for a fun little coding project. 

As I migrate my business to Python, I think this could be a fun way to expose myself to coding more, to create a more well rounded knowledge base. 

Also I have just been getting really bored by video games, and figured why not trying to replace this time with time spent programming!

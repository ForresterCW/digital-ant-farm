## Welcome to my little hobby project! 

Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by ants and their intricate dynamics. Their pheromone-based pathfinding seems like perfect inspiration for a fun coding project.

As I migrate my business to Python, I think this could be a fun way to expose myself to coding more, to create a more well rounded knowledge base.
